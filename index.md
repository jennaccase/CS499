# CS-499 Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Jenna Case and I started attending Southern New Hampshire Univeristy in September 2022. I chose to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science to work alongside my Bachelor's in Applied Engineering to advance my career in manufacturing analysis. This github page is designed to showcase the skills that I learned throughout my time at SNHU into an ePortfolio.

# Enhancement One

This project came from CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. This project was created to provide create, update, and delete functions for a task program. This project also incorporated JUnit testing to make sure that the programs function correctly and according to the specifications set. The basis of this project was to use JUnit testing to make sure that the program functions as intended when unexpected input is entered by the user.
The main enhancement I made on this project is to translate the code from Java into Python. I believe that this showcases my knowledge of both languages and shows my knowledge of the project as well. This highlights my skills in software testing. This enhancement develops my skills in Java and Python to find functions that act the same. This also develops my skills in unit testing as well since this project culminated the bulk of my experience. The course outcomes I demonstrate with this enhancement are as follows. The first is to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. The second is to develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
The process for this enhancement was straightforward. The biggest issue I ran into was getting the loops to work the same and getting the random number generator to work. I had to change method names so that they followed Python naming guidelines. I decided to use ‘datetime’ to handle the dates and to replace ‘jave.util.date’. I was able to utilize Python’s built in list instead of a java vector. The only other issue I see with the project going forward is with the classes and making sure everything connects correctly as I’m more familiar in that regard with Java. 

# Enhancement Two

This project came from CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms. This was created to demonstrate the use of binary search trees in C++. This code was built to filter and sort through a file of bids. A binary tree is a data structure that contains nodes (some type of data) and references (pointers). It is organized in a hierarchical structure and is used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Binary trees are set up to be efficient.
One part of the enhancement I want to make on this project is to fix the functionality and clean up the comments. This will help showcase my understanding of the assignment as well as my knowledge of data structures and how they are used. The second part of the enhancement I want to make is to improve the efficiency of the project. I am aiming to be able to sort the bids in order by bid ID. I want to add functionality to the code to sort the bids in order and print them. I was able to complete this by adding a second binary search tree. The course outcomes I demonstrate with this enhancement are: design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  
I learned a lot more about binary search trees through this enhancement. I was able to figure out how to utilize two binary search trees to improve efficiency. I was also able to fix the original project so that it operates the way it was intended. 

# Enhancement Three

This project was created in CS 340: Client/Server Development. This is an interactive database made for animal rescue centers. The project in current state contains basic create, read, update, and delete functionality. It is created in Python and made to interact with Pymongo. The overall enhancement that I am looking to complete is including SQL functions for create, read, update, and delete. I also plan to add some more advanced SQL functions into the code like insert multiple, update multiple, and delete multiple. This will show my knowledge of SQL functionality and that I can expand upon basic code functions. This also shows my skills in Python data structure code.
The first of the course outcomes I plan to demonstrate with this enhancement are to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. The second is to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.  The third is to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  
I feel that I did meet the course objectives I planned to with this enhancement. I learned more about SQL functions and how to formulate a database. The only challenges I faced was with getting everything to translate well into Python since it is a language I do not use a lot.
