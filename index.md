## Introduction

Hello! My name is Jenna Case and I started attending Southern New Hampshire Univeristy in September 2022. I chose to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science to work alongside my Bachelor's in Applied Engineering to advance my career in manufacturing analysis. This github page is designed to showcase the skills that I learned throughout my time at SNHU into an ePortfolio.
